# Subset Sum problem performance analysis

## Top-down/Tabular approach

| Testcase | Result | Time taken |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | passed | 0 ms |
| 2 | passed | 3990 ms |
| 3 | passed | 3355550 ms |
| 4 | passed | 0 ms |
| 5 | passed | 996 ms |

### Time complexity:
O(n\*w) here, n is size of input array and w is sum
### Space complexity:
O(n\*w) here, O(n\*w) for storing the dp table of n\*w size
